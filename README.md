# RECOGNITION-OF-GESTURE
Recognition Of Gesture Project:- Gesture recognition using ESP32 with MPU6050 and Edge Impulse. Motion data is collected, labeled, and trained with spectral features. The trained model is deployed via Arduino IDE for real-time gesture classification in IoT, gaming, and assistive applications.
